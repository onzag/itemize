     * Itemize contains constants that are used to setup how its internals
     * works, this section allows to override some of these constants, some
     * are not exposed as they are of no use for it

     *   Defaults to 10000 characters
     * 
     * MAX_RAW_TEXT_LENGTH
     *   The maximum size for rich text types, in characters
     *   Defaults to 100000 characters
     *   It's better if you specify a maxLenght for these rich texts as
     *   This acts more as a security check
     * 
     * MAX_FILE_SIZE
     *   The maximum file size in bytes
     *   Defaults to 5000000 bytes or 5MB
     *

     *   How many files a property of type file might have tops
     *   Defaults to 25
     * 
     * MAX_FILES_PER_REQUEST
     *   How many files a request might have maximum total
     *   This is a soft check and is used to build a total maximum
     *   tolerance on byte size of the files that are added, which means
     *   it multiplies the file size by this number and that's the limit
     * 
     * MAX_FIELD_SIZE
     *   The maximum size in bytes of a rq request, the text portion
     *   only
     * 
     * MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS_DEFAULT
     *   The default amount of search results you are able to retrieve
     *   when performing a search, defaults to 50
     *   Most modules will have an idependent value for this and it's recommended

     * 
     * MAX_SEARCH_RECORDS_DEFAULT
     *   The default amount of records you are able to retrieve when performing
     *   a search, defaults to 200
     *   Most modules will have an idependent value for this and it's recommended
     *   to do it that way rather than the global config
     * 
     * MAX_SEARCH_FIELD_LENGTH
     *   The maximum size in characters of the search field functionality, that is
     *   how long the search query can be
     *   Defaults to 1000
     * 
     * SERVER_DATA_MIN_UPDATE_TIME
     *   The minimum amount of time the server data should update, this is basically
     *   currency factor information
     *   This is a number in milliseconds
     *   Defaults to 259200000 or 3 days
     * 
     * SERVER_MAPPING_TIME
     *   The time cycle it takes for the server to refresh and add new sitemaps
     *   This is a number in milliseconds
     *   Defaults to 86400000 or 1 day
     * 
     * MAX_REMOTE_LISTENERS_PER_SOCKET
     *   How many listeners can be added per socket
     *   This specifies the number of items and search the client can keep track of at once
     *   Defaults to 100
     *

     *   The role for the admin
     *   Defaults to "ADMIN"
