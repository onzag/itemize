# Initialization

To configure itemize isn't the easiest nor the most straightforward process, it relies on a conjuction of different APIs

## Requeriments

At the time of this writing due to many limitations with incompatible updates itemize requires the following stack:

- NodeJS version 15
- npm version 6.14.16 (it will not work with newer)
- Python (tested with 2.7, to build the codebase)
- Build Essentials (to build the codebase)
- Docker

Itemize currently only works under a linux system, it was tested under WSL with it not being capable to complete a npm install; while theorethically it should work the same way under WSL in practise the setup proves inconviently complex as many things fail.

## Settings requirements

### Docker

Please ensure that for using a development enviroment docker is running without sudo, for that you may run the following command, for example, in ubuntu

`sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`

Provided that your current user has root privileges.

### Virtual memory

Some errors may arise if the virtual memory is not enough, ensure to increase it, on linux this is done via the following command (AS ROOT)

Become root.

`sudo su`

Increase the virtual memory

`echo "vm.max_map_count=262144" >> /etc/sysctl.conf && echo "vm.max_map_count=262144" >> /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf`

Exit root

`exit`

Reload

`sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144 && sudo sysctl -p && sudo sysctl --system`


## Fast initialization

1. Make a directory

`mkdir myprojekt`

2. And get into it

`cd myprojekt`

3. initialize the project

`npm init`

4. run the command to install the dependencies

`npm install --save react@^17.0.2 react-dom@^17.0.2 @types/react@^17.0.38 @types/react-dom@^17.0.11 @mui/icons-material@^5.3.1 @mui/lab@5.0.0-alpha.66 @mui/material@5.3.1 @mui/styles@5.3.0 @emotion/css@^11.7.1 @emotion/react@^11.7.1 @emotion/server@^11.4.0 @emotion/styled@^11.6.0 @onzag/itemize-text-engine`

5. Install itemize

`npm install --save @onzag/itemize`

6. Run the setup, and you may want to specify the languages, otherwise you are free to use the defaults for everything

`./node_modules/.bin/itemize setup`

7. Build the project

`npm run build`

8. Start a development environment

`npm run start-dev-environment development`

9. Build the development database

`npm run build-database development`

10. Start a dev server with the basic flags

`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 NO_SSR=true NO_SEO=true FAKE_EMAILS=true FAKE_SMS=true npm run start-dev-server`

## Create your first project

### Create a folder where you intend your project to be hosted

Make a directory say

`mkdir myprojekt`

And get into it

`cd myprojekt`

### Inialize a npm project and intall itemize

`npm init`

Install the peer dependencies; the peer dependencies are required as they are used by itemize during the build process, specifying a version is necessary because older npm versions will simply not install peer dependencies which will cause itemize not to work

As a result of npm design the following command should be run.

As for the time of version 0.2xx

`npm install --save react@^17.0.2 react-dom@^17.0.2 @types/react@^17.0.38 @types/react-dom@^17.0.11 @mui/icons-material@^5.3.1 @mui/lab@^5.0.0-alpha.66 @mui/material@^5.3.1 @mui/styles@^5.3.0 @emotion/css@^11.7.1 @emotion/react@^11.7.1 @emotion/server@^11.4.0 @emotion/styled@^11.6.0 @onzag/itemize-text-engine`

Install itemize

`npm install --save @onzag/itemize`

### Things to Consider

Please ensure docker is installed and running

Before running this step you might want to consider getting api keys from the following services, without these Itemize will not work at its full potential, if you are coming from the tutorial you might skip all these.

#### Container Storage Provider

By default you do not need any container storage provider, as it will be simply stored as a file to the hard drive, this however requires that you only have one cluster as this will not work with clusters over different machines, it is only recommended for development, for production unless you have a very small service, you should not have any local storage provider and instead get containers.

The storage is necessary for SEO and file support,

##### Default Storage Provider: Openstack Object Storage

Object storage is provided by several providers, and it's the default used in itemize when no provider has been specified it will assume that it is object storage, you can get as many as you want to but try to have them acrross different countries.

Some providers of object storage are (you can combine them):

- `https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/object-storage/`
- `https://www.linode.com/content/deploying-object-storage-bucket/`

Once you get credentials for these buckets you may add them as such:

```
{
    "containers": {
        "EUROPE": {
            "username": "user",
            "password": "secret",
            "region": "DE",
            "domainId": "default",
            "domainName": "domain",
        }
    }
}
```

You might get many of these containers in order to setup a CDN of kinds, different countries can have different containers where data is stored for such.

You can add as many as you need, but it's only possible to have one local.

#### Logging

By default your logs will go to the main database (no elastic enabled) or with elasticsearch it will log to elasticsearch.

This is why it's recommended to always have elasticsearch on, otherwise the logs will have nowhere to go.

In any case, fallback will always log to file; so some logs (for example connection error logs) will log to files, and logging will resume back to elasticsearch/main database once it's reestablished.

##### Default Logging Provider: Main Database

Not recommended, this occurs when the device does not know where to log, requires no setup and this is simply what will happen if elasticsearch is not available.

##### Default Logging Provider: Elasticsearch

Recommended method, logs are sent to elasticsearch where they can be searched and analyzed with kibana.

#### Mapping

Mapping is what is used to represent and manage locations in a human readable way by default no mapping is available and attempts to use location will end up in errors.

The fast prototyping renderer will use openstreetmaps by default in this case at least for display.

##### Default Mapping Provider: Here Maps

`https://developer.here.com/` For usage in geocoding, geolocation, and autocomplete; the service doesn't need to be paid for initial usage; use it if you have the location type in your schema.

For the activation of just being used in seaches, geolocation and autocomplete it should be done within the `index.sensitive.json`

```json
"locationSearch": {
    "apiKey": "cObZ0Os1S-Nn8k18xv_yiJLR3W31v9BcGv1_AKm66ZM"
},
```

You can activate here maps, over OSM in the maps visual as well by setting up your `index.sensitive.json` with the following `shared` configuration, replace API_KEY_HERE with your api key.

Note that this is specific to the fast prototyping location entry and view renderer, if using other renderer this will have no effect.

```json
"shared": {
    "leafletAttribution": "&copy; HERE 2019",
    "leafletUrl": "https://2.base.maps.ls.hereapi.com/maptile/2.1/maptile/newest/normal.day/{z}/{x}/{y}/512/png8?ppi=320&apiKey=API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

#### Email

The email service allows you have the capability of using your project to send and receive its own emails; Itemize however does not act as an SMTP server, so a service provider is needed.

By default itemize will simply log the emails being sent to console.

##### Default Email Provider: Mailgun

`https://www.mailgun.com/email-api/` Mailgun email API, for usage to send emails to user as well as validation and recovery, if not available, you might want to consider removing the email and e_validated property and restructuring the app, without mailgun sending validation emails and recovering accounts as well as login with email is not truly possible.

In order to set it up the key is retrieved and placed at `index.sensitive.json` as

```json
"mail": {
    "apiKey": "API_KEY",
    "endpoint": "https://api.eu.mailgun.net/v3"
}
```

#### Phone

Similar to emails but to send text messages.

##### Default Phone Provider: ????

Currently it's not enabled and text messages cannot truly be sent

#### User Localizatiom

The user localization provider is used in order to establish the country of user you are getting a visit from which will set initial language, currency and country of origin.

##### Default Localizatiom Provider: Elasticsearch

As long as elasticsearch is available (which should be) this will be used in order to determine the user localization), as this is one of elasticsearch capabilities and comes free of cost; and this will always be the case and no configuration is required.

##### Default Localizatiom Provider: IPStack

Otherwise if elasticsearch is disabled (not recommended), the default is ipstack and it requires configuration.

`https://ipstack.com/` An ipstack api key, this should not cost any money and you shouldn't need to pay until you have more than 10000 users; without an ip stack key user tracking to set up initial language and country is not possible and will use the fallbacks.

And in order to set it up at `index.sensitive.json` should be set with

```json
"userLocalization": {
    "apiKey": "API_KEY",
    "httpsEnabled": false,
}
```

#### Currency Support

By default currency support is not enabled and attempting to use currencies will result in an error if no server data for the factors could be established.

With currency support the values of the currency are stored based on a global currency.

##### Default Currency Provider: Currency Layer

`https://currencylayer.com/` A currency layer api key, this should not cost any money until due to the fact that itemize updates the currency factors only every so often, use only if you need/use currency types in your system.

And in order to set it up at `index.sensitive.json` should be set with

```json
"userLocalization": {
    "apiKey": "API_KEY",
    "httpsEnabled": false,
}
```

#### Payment Support

By default payments are not enabled and payment objects cannot be resolved, in order to do so a payment provider must be enabled.

A payment provider is however not required for the owner of a payment object that has edit rights to establish this payment or subscription and change its state manually, the payment provider is only needed to do so automatically; for example a card payment that will setup a payment directly into the paid state without the user who triggered such action having the permissions.

##### Default Payment Provider: ?????

Currently there's no way to resolve payments externally.

#### USSD Support

USSD is an acient prototocol to be used in development countries to provide for services, itemize allows to create apps for this sort of protocol.

You may use FAKE_USSD=true in order to test this functionality, note that using FAKE_USSD in production opens up a big hole in the security as this enables a developer interface that acts like a mobile device for interaction with the app.

##### Default USSD Provider: ????

Currently there's no way to 

### Initial Configuration

Since nothing is configured yet you need to run

`./node_modules/.bin/itemize setup`

Follow the steps that are requested, there are many of them, more often than not the default configuration works, but this might not be the case, you will need the following; you will be asked for the previous information, you mighst just press enter and accept everything; and then go to your config folder and setup from there

### Build your project

`npm run build`

This will run esbuild, typescript compiler and the build data process that is necessary.

### Start a development environment (optional but necessary if you don't have an external database/redis/elastic)

`npm run start-dev-environment development`

This will spawn both redis and postgreSQL using your development configuration

Remember to stop the dev environment once you are done

`npm run stop-dev-environment development`

### Update your database

`npm run build-database development`

This will build the database

### Start the development server

`npm run start-dev-server`

This will start the development server locally and listening at localhost:8000

Note that this will start a development server that uses all the configuration available which is not recommended for a development server environment where code is meant to constantly change, a better start consists of

`NO_SSR=true NO_SEO=true FAKE_EMAILS=true FAKE_SMS=true npm run start-dev-server`

And if you are using elasticsearch with tls in your own build (default) you must also include the flag for unathorized tls handshakes.

`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 NO_SSR=true NO_SEO=true FAKE_EMAILS=true FAKE_SMS=true npm run start-dev-server`

### Access your application

Open your favorite browser and go to `localhost:8000` it should be up and running there

## Initialize an already existing project

After you have gotten the files for the project you will need the config files, the config files are not included in source control, as such you need to get them in a different way since they contain sensitive information.

After that you should run `npm run build` and then you might start a dev environment via `npm run start-dev-environment development` and if required you should run `npm run build-database development`, if your project has a `dump` folder which includes the databse dump that might be necessary to make the database function you will have to import those dumps using `npm run build-database development load-dump`

Then start a dev server via `npm run start-dev-server`

## Additional Steps

### See the automatically generated rq endpoints

Previously graphql was being used in the development but it was found to cause issues with multiple dependencies and a the custom form data spec had to be used, which is why the rq system was developed to be a replacement for graphql that would create more compact and simpler endpoints.

You may access the available options at the `/rq` endpoint

### Get the admin user

The admin user is automatically generated if not found and this is done by the global manager, when starting in developing mode you should have gotten your admin user log information with the temporary password displayed in the terminal, example:

`info: GlobalManager.addAdminUserIfMissing: Sucessfully added admin user {"username":"admin","password":"c2bf50ba9bd142f29ea40fab653a7689","timestamp":"2020-09-16T16:42:46.249Z"`

These are your login credentials within the application for the administrator with the role ADMIN, if you have no terminal logs eg. ran it in production mode instead of development, it can be found in the info logs via:

`cat logs/info.ABSOLUTE.log.2020-09-16 | grep "GlobalManager.addAdminUserIfMissing"`

And that should show the relevant lines, note that the date 2020-09-16 should be replaced to the log day, the format is YYYY-MM-DD

### Setup the npm token

Itemize requires you to use the npm token in order to build and ship your application, this is partly because it's a more robust method that replicates how you currently build in your environment, since itemize uses npm and the npm registry, in order to specify your token you need to do

`echo "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" > .npm-token`

Even if you have access to the repository you need this file as docker and the docker npm user does not have such direct access, the setup will take care of the rest

### Install docker-compose

Install docker compose in order to be able to run deployments

## Other initialization options

### Start the development server (NO_SSR, NO_SEO, FAKE_SMS and FAKE_EMAILS mode)

Having SSR enabled can disrupt development, because this means that there will be a mismatch whenever you do changes and rebuild and package your application, this is seen in depth in [Developing Flow](./developing-flow.md) this usually goes in combination with disabling service workers as otherwise changes will not reflect, so a common way to start your development server is:

`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 NO_SSR=true NO_SEO=true FAKE_EMAILS=true FAKE_SMS=true npm run start-dev-server`

Note that restarts are still required if for example there are changes to the schema files.

The reason you accept unauthorized is because the dev environment (if running elasticsearch) uses a self signed certificate, and it's a different one with each dev environment so accepting unauthorized is the better option for development only.

In production you should rather have your own elasticsearch instance.

#### Start Kibana (if you are using elasticsearch)

If you are using elasticsearch and have configured it you can access the logs as well as the cached search information for used in fast and full text search with the elastic strategy.

In order to start kibana in this development environment you will need to first create an enrollment token, first find the countainer that ends with the `_devedb` suffix and is running elasticsearch.

```sh
docker ps
```

Find the container that ends with `_devedb` it should have your application name before it, you will need that identifier.

```sh
docker exec -it my_application_name_devedb /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana
```

You will be output a token, copy it, you will need it; now you shall get kibana running, you will need to do the same regarding the network name that you will use and connect it to your development environment

```sh
docker network ls
```

Find the one that contains your application name within it, eg. `my_application_name_network` that is the one that the dev environment is using, now you can launch kibana with that

```sh
docker run --net my_application_name_network --name kibana -p 5601:5601 docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:8.2.0
```

It will prompt you in your browser and request you for the token, once you paste the token you will then proceed to login, your username should be `elastic` and the password is whatever you put in the `db.sensitive.json` for elastic password.

And that's all you should be within kibana with those steps, remember once you are done to stop this container before running `stop-dev-environment`.

```sh
docker stop kibana
docker rm kibana
```

### Start the silly server

`npm run start-silly-server`

The silly server is the same as the development server but logs much more information, normally used when changes to itemize are required or bugs are found within it, everything that is verbose and marked as silly is logged, which can mean a lot of information to work with.

### Start the production server

`npm run start-silly-server`

Not really recommended to use, will connect and use production configuration files and nothing is logged to the console, minified files take priority when being served, and you will need to use the devkey in your cookie to switch to development files, regarding that.

### Switch to development mode on production builds

Debugging in production can be a pain, this is why itemize provides with a devkey option, in order to use the devkey it is recommended that you clear up everything in your browser, cookies, storage, cache; your devkey should be in your sensitive config information, looking like eg. `NwKFS1rODXqf4D8D` or a custom value that you have set it as.

Please ensure to have service workers disabled, otherwise you might be served the default mode version.

In order to switch the mode, open the console in your browser and run `SET_DEV_MODE("development", "YOUR_KEY");` or `SET_DEV_MODE("production", "YOUR_KEY");` this should make it so that the mode is switched, and do a hard refresh, now you should have a development version of the client up and running which should help debugging even on your live production builds.

Note that this will cause SSR to die off, as SSR can only run in the default mode as the server can only run on one mode at a time, so this is not good for debugging SSR issues; but you should now have available, custom logs, react tools, and other tools that use development builds right on live.

The development build is protected by default, so it can't be easily accessed unless it's the development server, it's considered a protected resource this should help by adding obscurity on top of it (don't confuse it with security, as minified files can also be analyzed); this is only to make copycats and replication by harmful parties harder, but not impossible.

## Start hacking

Now you know all the basic initialization steps, you should now follow one of the [Tutorials](../tutorials/README.md) which will explain how to create a airbnb like website using itemize.
